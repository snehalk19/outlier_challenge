Example of Git Rebase
## The Challenge

There are two pull requests open on this repo. Each change is in its own branch. The challenge is to use `git rebase` to add both changes to `master`. When you are finished, your `master` branch should have three commits in the following order:

```
* feat: add base64 endpoint
* feat: add user-agent endpoint
* init
```

_ Any errors, missing features, missing tests, or failing tests will disqualify the solution. _
